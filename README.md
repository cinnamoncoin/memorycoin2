# memorycoin2
windows binary based on source here https://github.com/memorycoin/memorycoin
i built it from the source above but it says it is Memorycoin version v2.999.999.1-gv3010123.010.102

no changes made although i used  the latest open ssl 1.0.2a for upgraded security

win qt i made for my personal use with the latest tools,  has qr support , ect.... everything appearss to work ok

except for one little thing..... lol

the button for the 'new address' on the receive tab is missing !! 

this may need a small fix !! MR3qKPgKGYAmV21dKGR1BCE67XoqrrRMEg

also the links on the votes tab in the qt client seem to not reslove to the proper webpage
